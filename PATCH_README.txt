RAR Landing — Scroll-to-Reserve Patch
Files included:
- app/page.jsx (replacement)

How to apply:
1) In your GitHub repo (rar-landing or rar-landing-clean), click "Add file" → "Upload files".
2) Upload the /app/page.jsx from this zip to the exact same path, confirm overwrite, and commit to main.
3) Vercel auto-deploys. Buttons ("Select …", "Reserve Now", header CTA) will smooth-scroll to the form.
