From Tokyo to Miyajima – Journey Highlights

Our itinerary balances exploration and rest: grounding in Tokyo, temple visits and tea in Kamakura, mineral‑rich baths in Beppu, and still evenings on Miyajima island. We’ve woven space throughout for naps, journaling and spontaneous joy because travel should restore you.
